# Nearby Business Search with Google Maps codelab

## Description

This repo provides the resource files (project template and finished code) for the [Build a Nearby Business Search service with Google Maps Platform codelab][codelab], a codelab that shows you how to build a basic web app using the [Maps JavaScript API][js-api] and [Places API][places-api] in the Google Maps Platform.
